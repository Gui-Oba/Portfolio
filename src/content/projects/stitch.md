### 🏆 *First Place Prize at McGill AI Society's 2025 Hackathon*

## Our idea was this: Scratch, but for neural networks

This project combines a React/TypeScript front end with a FastAPI/PyTorch back end to let users build, train, inspect, and test Neural Networks. It powers an interactive UI where you can draw digits, launch hyper‑parameter sweeps, inspect layer architectures, and visualize how pixels flow through the network. It is meant to be an educational tool for people wanting to learn more about the world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
