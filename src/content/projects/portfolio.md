## Building the experience

I wanted this portfolio to feel calm, deliberate, and fast. The layout embraces generous whitespace and motion restraint so the content breathes.

Under the hood:

- A Markdown-first content layer for writing and project notes.
- Custom ShadCN-inspired component library to keep typography and spacing consistent.
- Image tooling that optimizes photography assets at build time.

## Iterating in public

Because this is my sandbox, I keep shipping small updates—new sections, better interactions, and performance tweaks.
