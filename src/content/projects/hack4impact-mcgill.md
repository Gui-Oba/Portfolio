## Goals

Hack4Impact McGill needed a new website that could keep up with the pace of projects and the expectations of partner organizations. We focused on clarity, case-study storytelling, and an application flow that felt welcoming.

## Highlights

- Crafted layered hero sections spotlighting recent launches.
- Introduced reusable case-study blocks that content teams can fill without dev help.
- Optimized for accessibility from the start—keyboard navigation and color contrast were non-negotiable.
- Lean Next.js + Vercel stack with ISR so updates push live instantly during application season.

## Outcome

Applications grew and partner inquiries doubled within the first cycle of the relaunch. The modular component system means future cohorts can continue to evolve the brand with minimal friction.
