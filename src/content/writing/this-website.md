I rebuilt my portfolio to showcase the work I'm most proud of without burying everything in animations. The goal: keep the site fast, accessible, and easy to iterate on between classes.

## **Stack Decisions**

- **Vite + React 19** for snappy local dev and modern SSR-friendly APIs.
- **Tailwind primitives** without the full framework—just enough utility classes to move quickly.
- **Type-safe data files** so the UI always matches the content I intend to display.

## **Designing for Focus**

I kept the layout intentionally minimal. The hero centers the logo and CTA, while the projects and gallery aim to balance text with visual cues. Typography is system-first so it inherits whatever device people browse with.

## **Continuous Iteration**

This site is a lab. Some days I'm tweaking the gallery, other days I'm experimenting with markdown-driven blog posts (like this one!). I'm leaving room for future integrations—maybe a newsletter, maybe a lightweight CMS.

## **Fun with Graphics**

The few pixelated SVGs you see around the site were all designed by me! I've always loved expressing myself through art, and I thought it added a personal touch to the website.
